                <p>Hi ! As you may know now, I'm Jean-Arthur !
                    I'am first and foremost a tech lover, but you'll also find me on the road riding a beatiful bike or behind bar (pretending I know how to flair) !
                    I see my self as a tech-adventurer, as most of the things I love and learned are "IT-oriented".
                    I'm still someone curious, who loves to discovers new things ! Please enjoy your way through this self digital portrait !
