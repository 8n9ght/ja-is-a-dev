# Welcome to My Portfolio 🖖

This project was made with ❤️ & passion using `react.js` & `three.js`

The purpose was to renew the way we give life to website content. It's a constant but beautiful challenge. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did developping it.

## What you can expect to find on my portfolio 🔍

- 🧑‍🚀 A quick introduction of who I am and why I do what I do (I guess...?) 
- 🛠 Some skills I've learned (but not all of them, it would be a mess 😅)
- 🖼 My latest web projects (and more soon)
- 💌 A quick way to get in touch if you want work with me on something great !

### What I hope to deliver with this project (futur features) 🚀

- 🛸 A unique immersive experience
- 🕹 More unique assets
- 💎 A display of other skills

Feel free to follow me if this project reaches your very deep soul (no kidding but it would be nice though)

See you soon on https://jean-arthur.is-a.dev
